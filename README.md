# Python_Black_Jack_Card_Game
This is a python GUI app based off of the card game blackjack, also known as 21. It is GUI because there is no fun when it's just simply words and text on a screen. 
It is intended to have actual cards here, as well as sounds, and a background displaying a casino table. Mostly this is just an app for people to play for fun.
